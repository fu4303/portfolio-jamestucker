After originally building my site with a React template published by Creative Tim, I decided to create a custom-built site 
with Vue/Nuxt.js that integrated with a CMS. I'm really happy with my decision! I'm a Vue fanatic, if you didn't know already, and highly recommend using it as the foundation for your own personal website.

## Roadmap

* Redo animations/transitions
* Update link hover effects - they're effin' ugly right now
* Categorize blog posts by tag so users can search and select posts accordingly
* Add a "this will take X minutes to read" badge to blog posts
* Add pagination to blog
* Add newsletter sign-up form

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Tech 

- Nuxt.js SPA(Single Page Application)
- Bulma for styling/SCSS
- Netlify for static hosting
- Forestry for headless CMS/blog
